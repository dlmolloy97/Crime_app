## Project outline
For this project, crime data from the City of Boston's API was summarised by day of the week and hour of the day, in order to show how crime risk was distributed over various levels of time, and then visualised using Plotly. The intention of this exercise was to practice using the dropdown menu feature in ReactJS.

### Results and analysis 
Perhaps surprisingly, the least dangerous time appears to be between 04:00 and 05:00 (this is most likely explained, however, by the fact that very few potential crime victims are out and about at this hour). The most dangerous single point was approximately 17:00 on Friday.
